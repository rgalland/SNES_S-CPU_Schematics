# SNES_S-CPU_Schematics
Reverse engineering of the SNES CPU from die shots found at https://siliconpr0n.org/map/nintendo/s-cpu-a/single/nintendo_s-cpu-a_mcmaster_mz_ns20x.jpg
SVG file has link to die shot but is not included in repository because of its large size. Download it from link above and copy into the root of this repository. 
Inkscape has been used to create the SVG file.

Most cells have been identified but this is still very much WIP at the moment.
